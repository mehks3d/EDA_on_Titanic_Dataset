# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to my project on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using the Titanic dataset! This project is about exploring and understanding the data behind one of the most well-known machine learning problems – predicting survival on the Titanic.

You can view the full notebook here: [EDA on Titanic Dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/mehks3d/EDA_on_Titanic_Dataset)

## 📌 What is this project about?

The main goal of this project is to explore the Titanic dataset and find interesting patterns, clean the data, and understand the relationship between different features and the survival of passengers.

I’ve used Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to do all the analysis and visualizations.

---

## 🧾 What's inside the dataset?

The dataset has information about passengers on the Titanic like:

- Name
- Age
- Gender (Sex)
- Ticket Class (Pclass)
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)
- Number of parents/children aboard (Parch)
- Fare paid
- Port of embarkation (Embarked)
- And most importantly – whether the person **survived or not**

---

## 🔍 What did I do in this notebook?

Here’s a quick summary of what’s covered:

1. **Loaded the dataset** and explored its structure
2. **Checked for missing values** and cleaned the data
3. **Analyzed individual columns** (like Age, Fare, Sex, Pclass, etc.)
4. **Created visualizations** using Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand the trends
5. **Looked at survival rates** based on gender, age, class, and other features
6. **Drew some key insights** from the data

---

## 📊 Some interesting insights

- **Women had a much higher survival rate** than men.
- **People in first class** had better chances of survival.
- **Children under 10** were more likely to survive.
- The **port of embarkation** also seemed to have some effect on survival chances.
